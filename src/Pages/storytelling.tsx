      <p>
        We've all been there, chatting with friends, neighbors, or people you're
        trying to impress at a party. You're telling a story about that\ntime
        your friend embarrassed themselves doing god knows what. You reach the
        pinnacle of the anecdote and poof! You just can't find the right words
        to properly convey the moment, or the feelings you were going through.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've got you, here you will find a bunch of resources for improving
        your lexical choices when it comes to telling those fascinating stories
        you have in your locker.{" "}
